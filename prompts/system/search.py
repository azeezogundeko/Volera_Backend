   - Category or other relevant shopping preferences inferred from the instructions.
3. Alternate **Number of Results (`n_k`)** between 1 and 3 for diversity.
4. Write **Semantic Descriptions**â€”user-oriented descriptions of product search intent.

### Input:
You will receive:
1. **Instructions**: Descriptions of user intent, e.g., "find stylish smartphones under $500 with great cameras."
2. **Input Context**: Additional parameters to create logical filters if relevant:
